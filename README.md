## Projects I have been working on:

# [Project 1: Analysis of chess games](https://www.kaggle.com/noobiedatascientist/analysis-of-lichess-games)
- [Condensed and enriched](https://github.com/george-kan/chess_project) the raw data found in the [lichess website](https://database.lichess.org/) 
- Created a publicly available [new dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noobiedatascientist/lichess-september-2020-data) with all the new features
- Analysed the popularity of different openings accross rating as well as their success rate for White and Black
- Investigated the relationship between Elo rating and the occurance of inaccurate moves
- Predicted the game outcome using Random Forests (R ranger package)

Random forests | Opening popularity | Game variability
