## Projects I have been working on:

# [Analysis of chess games](https://www.kaggle.com/noobiedatascientist/analysis-of-lichess-games)
- Condensed and enriched the raw data found in the [lichess website](https://database.lichess.org/) turning them into a [new dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noobiedatascientist/lichess-september-2020-data)
- Analysed the popularity of different openings accross rating as well as their success rate for White and Black
- Investigated the relationship between Elo rating and the occurance of inaccurate moves
- Predicted the game outcome using Random Forests (R ranger package)
